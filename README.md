# Gift Fun Game 🎁

A playful, romantic interactive web page created to surprise Farah! This fun game presents a question: "Do you still want a gift from me?" with two buttons - but there's a twist!

## 🎮 How It Works

The page features two buttons:
- **"Yes" Button**: Tries to evade the mouse cursor! When you hover over it or try to click it, it randomly moves to a different position on the screen, making it impossible to click.
- **"No" Button**: A perfectly functional button that reveals a sweet romantic message when clicked.

Each time you attempt to click "Yes", the page shows:
- A humorous prompt encouraging you to click "No" instead
- A funny meme that changes with each attempt

Clicking "No" reveals the true message: *"I agree with you! The real gift is me, and you shall tie the knot with me later this year. 💍❤️"*

## ✨ Features
