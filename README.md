# Gift Page

A playful, romantic web page to surprise your loved one! The page asks, "Do you still want a gift from me?" with a moving "Yes" button (impossible to click) and a functional "No" button. Each attempt to click "Yes" shows a funny prompt and meme. Clicking "No" reveals a sweet message.

## How to Use

1. Open `gift.html` in your browser to preview.
2. To make it public, upload this file to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel (see below).

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Rename `gift.html` to `index.html`.
2. Create a new GitHub repository and upload `index.html`.
3. Go to the repository's Settings > Pages.
4. Set the source to the main branch (root).
5. GitHub will provide a public link (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/reponame/`).

## Customization

- Edit prompts and meme URLs in the `<script>` section of `index.html` to personalize.
